# Logo Design Brief: Faff3 Rebrand

## 1. About the Brand

**Brand Name:** Faff3  
**Tagline Concept:** "Stop faffing. Start doing."

**What We Do:** Faff3 is a productivity platform that helps busy professionals and teams eliminate time-wasting activities, streamline workflows, and focus on what actually matters. The name playfully acknowledges the universal struggle of procrastination while offering the solution.

**The "3" Meaning:** Represents the three pillars of productivity: Focus, Flow, and Finish.

## 2. Brand Personality & Values

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Playful but Professional** | Witty and approachable, yet credible and trustworthy |
| **Energetic** | Dynamic, forward-moving, action-oriented |
| **Modern** | Clean, contemporary, tech-savvy |
| **Human** | Relatable, understanding, not robotic |

**Brand Voice:** Clever, direct, encouraging – like a supportive friend who gets you back on track with a smile.

## 3. Target Audience

- **Primary:** Professionals aged 25-45 working in fast-paced environments
- **Secondary:** Remote workers, freelancers, and small team leaders
- **Psychographics:** Ambitious, self-aware about productivity struggles, values simplicity

## 4. Design Direction

### Style Keywords
- Contemporary minimal
- Geometric with soft edges
- Confident but not aggressive
- Memorable and distinctive

### Logo Requirements
- **Primary logo:** Wordmark with optional icon/symbol
- **Icon version:** Standalone mark for app icons, favicons, social media
- **Versatility:** Must work in single color, reversed, and at small sizes

### The "3" Element
The numeral "3" should be integrated creatively – consider:
- Replacing the "e" in Faff3
- As a distinctive typographic element
- Abstract geometric interpretation (three dots, lines, or shapes)

## 5. Color Palette Direction

| Role | Suggested Colors | Rationale |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| **Primary** | Electric Coral (#FF6B6B) or Vibrant Teal (#00C9A7) | Energetic, stands out in productivity space dominated by blues |
| **Secondary** | Deep Navy (#1A1A2E) or Charcoal (#2D2D2D) | Grounds the brand, adds professionalism |
| **Accent** | Soft Cream (#FFF8E7) or Cool White (#F8F9FA) | Clean backgrounds, breathing room |

**Note:** Move away from typical "corporate blue" to differentiate in the market.

---

## 6. Typography Direction

- **Primary Font Style:** Modern geometric sans-serif (think: Circular, Gilroy, or custom)
- **Character:** Friendly, clean, slightly rounded terminals
- **The "3":** Should feel integrated, not like an afterthought – could be a custom glyph

---

## 7. Inspiration & Mood

**Brands to Reference (for vibe, not copy):**
- Notion – clean, modern, productivity-focused
- Slack – playful but professional
- Linear – refined, developer-friendly aesthetic
- Headspace – approachable wellness tech

**Avoid:**
- Overly corporate/stiff aesthetics
- Busy or complex illustrations
- Generic tech startup looks (gradient blobs, etc.)

## 8. Deliverables Requested

1. Primary logo (horizontal wordmark with integrated "3")
2. Stacked version for square formats
3. Icon/symbol for app and favicon use
4. Color variations (full color, single color, reversed)
5. Basic usage guidelines (clear space, minimum sizes)

---

- ✅ Be instantly memorable and distinctive
- ✅ Work beautifully at 16px (favicon) and on a billboard
